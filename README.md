# traffic

A Local Area Network (LAN) traffic monitor daemon that uses `tshark` from the
WireShark tool set.

In order to use this software you need to configure your LAN carefully, and
part of that configuration will need to be either:

 * a network tap (which will require code changes here), or

 * a mirroring network switch (which is what I use with this code).

I'll provide more info on this later...
